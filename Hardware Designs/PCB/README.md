This is the PCB design which is used to carry the Arduino mkr1000 and 3 A4988 drivers. 

The PCB design is created in the AD19.

The size of the board is 12cm*8cm

There are two different versions of the PCB design, as we used two different headers from motors. One PCB design called "CNC_shield_mkr1000_PCB_Header_EC381V", in which we use the motor with "EC381V" header. Another PCB design is called "CNC_shield_mkr1000_PCB_Header_NormalHeader", in which the header of motor used can match with the normal pin headers.
